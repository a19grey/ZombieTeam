-- fix /music/audio references for VITE  Vite’s public directory (e.g., project/public/) is a special folder. Anything in it—like images, audio files, or fonts—is copied to the root of your build output (dist/) during npm run build.
In your case, you likely have a file at public/audio/music/Pulse of the Shadows.mp3. After the build, Vite makes it available at /music/Pulse of the Shadows.mp3 (relative to the root), not /audio/music/Pulse of the Shadows.mp3.
