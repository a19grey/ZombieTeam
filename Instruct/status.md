# Zombie Survival Game - Status Report

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented a basic 3D zombie survival game using Three.js with the following features:

### Working Features
- **3D Environment**: A simple ground plane with proper lighting
- **Player Character**: Blue cylindrical character with a pistol
- **Player Controls**: 
  - WASD movement with direction-based speeds (slower when moving south)
  - Mouse aiming for independent weapon control
  - Hold left mouse button for continuous firing
- **Zombies**: 
  - Green cylindrical enemies that chase the player
  - Spawn primarily from the north to force player retreat
  - Zombie-to-zombie collision detection works properly
- **Combat System**:
  - Bullet firing and travel mechanics
  - Bullet-zombie collision detection
  - Zombie death and EXP rewards
- **UI Elements**:
  - Health display
  - Experience points counter
  - Zombie count display
  - On-screen instructions

### Current Issues
1. **Zombie-Player Collision Detection**: Despite multiple fixes, zombies still don't consistently damage the player when they collide. The collision detection code is in place, but there appears to be an issue with either:
   - The collision distance calculation
   - The way zombie positions are updated
   - How the player and zombie collision boundaries interact

2. **Performance**: As more zombies spawn, the game may experience performance issues on lower-end devices.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Collision Detection**: The most critical issue is fixing the zombie-player collision detection to ensure zombies properly damage the player when they make contact.

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Replace placeholder cylinders with proper 3D models
   - Add animations for player movement and zombie attacks
   - Improve visual effects for shooting and damage

3. **Gameplay Enhancements**:
   - Add different types of zombies with varying speeds and health
   - Implement power-ups and weapon upgrades
   - Add sound effects and background music

4. **Multiplayer Implementation**:
   - Set up Socket.IO for real-time communication
   - Implement player synchronization
   - Add cooperative mechanics (shared EXP, area power-ups)

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**: Some functions could be further optimized and modularized.
2. **Error Handling**: More robust error handling is needed throughout the codebase.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement object pooling for bullets and optimize zombie rendering.

## Conclusion

The game has a solid foundation with most core mechanics implemented. The primary focus should be on fixing the zombie-player collision detection issue before moving on to visual improvements and multiplayer functionality.
